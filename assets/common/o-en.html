    <h2>Manifest of Literal, Word-for-Word Translations. Pali-English</h2>
    <h5>Principles and approaches applied in cases of "translation o" - text fully translated from Pali, or "ed. o" - text fragment modified according to the Pali original.</h5>

<p><em>(Note: This Manifest is a translation from the Russian original. Some of the linguistic examples and discussions of nuance are best understood with reference to the source language.)</em></p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Any translation from Pali or translation of another author's translation, whether it's a complete text, text fragment, dictionary entry, topical article, or simply a term translation, in digital, printed, or oral form, as of today (<span id="date"></span>) is not considered final but is regarded as <strong>"Work in Progress"</strong> in preparation.  
            To obtain a final translation, meanings and terms must be correctly established.  
            If such a translation is possible, it can only be done by an Arahant with the four "analytical knowledges"  
            (<a href="/r/?s=pa%E1%B9%ADisambhid&q=an4.172#0.3">catasso paṭisambhidā</a>).
        </li>
        
        <script>
            const now = new Date();
            const formattedDate = String(now.getDate()).padStart(2, '0') + '-' +
                                String(now.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0') + '-' +
                                now.getFullYear();
            document.getElementById("date").textContent = formattedDate;
        </script>
        
        <li>Terminology in the Buddha's Teaching must be <strong>consistent</strong>, this is an integral part of any adequate instructions and documents, not to mention the Supreme Teacher and Supreme Teaching describing the most subtle, fundamental principles of the universe's workings and methods of its realization. Dhamma is <strong>not</strong> fiction. Meanings and definitions are uniform across all texts, especially those concerning the Four Noble Truths and adjacent layers of text. More details in <a href="#additional">"Additional Information"</a></li>   
        <li>If a concept has a definition in the suttas, that meaning is applied. Example: dukkha has definitions in the suttas. "Pain (dukkha) is bodily pain, bodily discomfort..." (Sutta "Analysis of Truths" <a href="/r/?q=mn141&s=dukkha&lang=pli-rus#16.1">mn141</a>) also in <a href="#additional">"Additional Information"</a>. Ignoring direct term definitions from suttas is considered unprofessional, conformist approach and renders the entire Buddha's Teaching as not well-formulated (not svākkhāto).</li>
        <li>If a definition cannot be found in the suttas but can be found in the Vinaya Vibhaṅga (hereinafter Vinaya), that meaning is applied.</li>
        <li>
            If a word's definition is found neither in the suttas nor in the Vinaya, then a systemic translation is preferred over a contextual one<a id="ast1Back" href="#ast1">*</a>. That is, ideally one word that maximally covers all usage contexts in all or most cases of its occurrence in the suttas and Vinaya. More about contextual translation issues in <a href="#additional">"Additional Information"</a>.
        </li>
        <li>If a word occurs too rarely or in monotonous cases, and it has no definition in the suttas and Vinaya, then a contextual or dictionary meaning is used.</li>     
        <li>
            If a generally accepted translation or interpretation, including from a commentary or sub-commentary of any concept, contradicts the above points — such translation or interpretation are not applied.
        </li>  
        
        <li>
            If a Pali concept is broader than a single concept in English, then a word cluster or a separate word from the cluster is used. Example: rāga — passion-enchantment, anicca — unreliability, instability, untrustworthiness, "impermanence". Such a cluster may be used at the first occurrence of the word in the text, further in the text only one key word is used. As if it were written: passion-enchantment (hereinafter passion). Or jhāyatha - ignite (ardently strive, concentrate, "meditate", contemplate), further ignite.
        </li>        
        <li>
            If a Pali concept is more specific, while the English concept is broader, then a clarification is used. Example: ceto — mind-thinking, citta — mind-state, mano — mind-representation. As if it were written: mind-state (hereinafter mind).
        </li>                
        <li>Preserving the word order in the Pali sentence is preferred.</li>
        <li>Preserving Pali grammatical structure is preferred.</li>
        <li>Case endings are used only in cases where the form without them sounds completely unnatural in English. However, when possible, it's recommended to omit case endings within compound words. For example, "joy-passion" should be read as "joy-passion"<a id="ast8Back" href="#ast8">*</a>, preserving their open, polysemantic structure.</li>
        <li>
            In cases of semantic divergence, the translation should be based on the meaning of the Pali term — just as is done with "false friends of the translator"<a id="ast5Back" href="#ast5">*</a>, that is, not by external similarity with English equivalents. More details — in section <a href="#additional">"Additional Information"</a>.

    <h4>Issues with Contextual Translation</h4>
    <p>
    Contextual translation was an appropriate path of least resistance for primary text translations when there were no English translations at all or in the process of creating translations directly from Pali to English, but as a result, a number of problems arose, including fundamental ones.</p>

    <p><strong>Exaggerated example:</strong></p>

    <p>In an imaginary text - word X is translated as "flying fox", in another word X is translated as "polo mallet". Contextual translation led to the word "bat" losing both its meanings, or acquiring additional unnecessary connotations.</p>

    <p><strong>Example 1 from translations:</strong></p>

    <p><code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">anicc-<strong>ucchādana-parimaddana</strong>-bhedanaviddhaṁsanadhammassa</code><br>
    ...body... subject to impermanence, <strong>deformation and abrasion</strong>, disintegration and dispersion.</p>

    <p>And the second case:<br>
    <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi"><strong>ucchādana-parimaddana</strong>-nhāpanasambāhanaṁ</code><br>
    "But he agrees to have them <strong>rub, massage</strong>, bathe, knead him."</p>

    <p><code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">ucchādana</code> (translated as deformation and rubbing) as in the example with the word "bow" the word covering (as smearing, covering, including as concealment for the case with unreliability and disintegration) acquired an inappropriate meaning, although it could have been verified and clarified.</p>

    <p><code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">parimaddana</code> (abrasion, massage) - instead of a general word, for example, kneading (when something is crumpled).</p>

    <p><strong>Example 2 fundamental problem</strong><br>
    <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">dukkha</code> - translated sometimes as pain, sometimes as suffering<a id="ast3Back" href="#ast3">*</a>, led to the cause (pain) becoming less important, and the consequence (suffering) becoming the main goal of Liberation.</p>

<p>The fact that the definition of dukkha exists in the Suttas is ignored everywhere, not only in English translations.
<a href="/r/?q=dn22&s=dukkha#18.18">dn22</a> - definitions of the concept in the practical realization of the four noble truths, <a href="/r/?q=mn141&s=dukkha#16.1">mn141</a> - definition of the concept in the four noble truths. </p>

<p><code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">Katamañcāvuso, dukkhaṁ? 
Yaṁ kho, āvuso, kāyikaṁ dukkhaṁ kāyikaṁ asātaṁ kāyasamphassajaṁ dukkhaṁ asātaṁ vedayitaṁ, 
idaṁ vuccatāvuso: 'dukkhaṁ'.</code><br> 

And what, friends, is pain?
That which, friends, is bodily pain, bodily discomfort, born of bodily contact, pain, discomfort felt, 
This is called, friends, "pain".

<br> 
<code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">Katamañcāvuso, domanassaṁ? 
Yaṁ kho, āvuso, cetasikaṁ dukkhaṁ cetasikaṁ asātaṁ manosamphassajaṁ dukkhaṁ asātaṁ vedayitaṁ, 
idaṁ vuccatāvuso: 'domanassaṁ'.</code>

<br>  
And what, friends, is "suffering" (discontent, dissatisfaction)?
That which, friends, is mental pain, mental discomfort, born of mental contact, pain, discomfort felt, 
This is called, friends, "suffering".

</p>

  <p>There is no definition of dukkha (pain) as "suffering" in the Suttas or Vinaya, on the contrary "suffering" (domanassa) is defined through the concept of "mental" pain (dukkha).</p>

 <p>But in the case of bodily pain-discomfort, contextual translation wasn't even needed. Since the word "pain" already has a meaning and even more suitable than "suffering". In a figurative sense, "pain" is a problem, something that requires a solution, without the hyperbolic "loudness" of the word "suffering". Example: This issue is my long-standing pain. Thus, the word "pain" covers all necessary contexts and preserves the priority of bodily sensation over the reaction to this sensation or experience (more on this below).</p>

<p>There are also fundamental problems arising from ignoring context. As in the case of the word <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">anta</code> - end, edge, boundary, threshold, limit, which is erroneously translated and continues to be translated as "extreme", even contrary to the context of the place in the text where it is so translated, not to mention other occurrences of this word where such meaning is completely inapplicable.</p> 

<code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">Tatra kho bhagavā pañcavaggiye bhikkhū āmantesi:</code><br>
Here the Blessed One addressed the group of five monks:<br><br>
  <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">"Dveme, bhikkhave, antā pabbajitena na sevitabbā.</code><br>
        "Two ends, monks, should not be approached by one gone forth.<br><br>
...<br>
<code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">Ete kho, bhikkhave, ubho ante anupagamma majjhimā paṭipadā tathāgatena abhisambuddhā cakkhukaraṇī ñāṇakaraṇī upasamāya abhiññāya sambodhāya nibbānāya saṁvattati.</code><br> 
Not approaching, monks, these two ends, the Middle Practice realized by the Tathagata gives vision, gives knowledge, leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to awakening, to nibbana.<br>

        <a href="https://dhamma.gift/r/?q=sn56.11#1.2">sn56.11</a>

<br><br>Certainly a phenomenon can have an intensity scale from minimum (end, boundaries, edge, threshold) to maximum (edge, limit, extreme). And the word "end" - can be in the meaning of both "threshold" and "limit", but the word "extreme" hardly refers to the beginning, and moreover, it is not even interpreted that way.
<br><br>
In this context the Buddha says that the Middle Practice "does not approach", "does not come near" <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">anupagamma</code> both edges. If it were said about extremes - this would assume that a certain range of involvement is allowed — until excessiveness is reached.
The Buddha's Teaching points to not approaching even the threshold, to complete non-involvement, neither in desires, nor in self-mortification, even in their minimal forms. 

<p>As a result of this distortion, the Teaching leading to maximum clarity and uncompromisingness — the Middle (in the sense of center, balance beyond extreme points) — acquired properties of "mediocrity" (averageness): the idea of compromise where "a little indulgence in desires" or "a little self-restriction" is allowed, just not "too much". The Middle Practice is not "moderation in passions and self-mortification", it is non-entry into either system of attachment. Therefore, such cases represent categorical distortions, not just translation inaccuracies.</p>
</li>

<li>
    <h4>Cross-Verifiability of Consistent Terminology</h4>
    <p>In addition to consistent terminology in the Buddha's Teaching, cross-verifiability and unidirectionality are easily traceable, preserving many principles including that the Tathagata's speech cannot be ambiguously contradictory <a href="/r/?s=dvayag%C4%81min%C4%AB&q=dn24#1.18.1">dvayagāmini</a>, and on the contrary, that the Dhamma should be well-formulated <a href="/r/?q=an3.70#7.4">svākkhāto</a>.</p>

    <p>Example: dukkha is defined in mn141, dn22 and other suttas as bodily pain, bodily discomfort. There is no definition of dukkha as "suffering" in the Suttas or Vinaya - this is merely the result of contextual "translation".</p>

    <p>In the 4 noble truths:<br>
    <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass-upāyāsa</code><br>

    <p>dukkha domanassa - two direct definitions: bodily and mental pain and discomfort respectively. bodily comes before mental.</p>

    <p>In satipatthanas:<br>
    <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">kāyo vedana</code> - the first two parts of satipatthana, <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">citta</code> - mind-state third</p>

    <p>In 6 dhatus (4 great elements + 2 dhatus):<br>
    4 great elements are all "bodily" (mn28) viññāṇadhatu ~mental or more precisely phenomenon producing mentality.</p>

    <p>In 5 aggregates of clinging:<br>
    <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">rūpa vedana sañña saṅkhārā viññāṇa</code> - ~matter, feeling of pleasant, pain, neither-pain-nor-pleasant, and only then come ~mental phenomena.</p>

    <p>In 6 internal bases:<br>
    <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">cakkhu soto ghāna jivha kāyo mano</code> - body is placed before mind-representation.</p>

    <p>In dependent origination (<a href="https://dhamma.gift/r/?q=sn12.2#14.2">sn12.2</a>):<br>
    avijjā - has a precise definition: not knowing about pain (dukkha) etc.<br>
    in definition of sankharas: body, speech, mind (body first)<br>
    viññāṇa - 6 types <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">kāyo mano</code> - body comes before mind.<br>

<code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">nāma-rūpa</code> name-~matter<br> 
name is <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">vedanā, saññā, cetanā, phasso, manasikāro</code>
 feeling, perception, volition, contact, attention. <br>
    vedana comes first before more ~mental phenomena such as for example cetana and manasikara.<br>
    in other condition sequences where body and mind can be distinguished the same principle as with viññāṇa - body or contact comes before mind or phenomenon (Dhamma).</p>

    <p>In types of activity (kamma): body, speech, mind (body first)</p>

    <p>Based on this principle, it can be understood that bodily pain-discomfort always had first priority, even indirectly, not to mention direct definitions, while "suffering, dissatisfaction" as a reaction or opinion about what is happening on the contrary was never a priority.</p>
</li>

<li>
    <h4>Semantic Divergence</h4>

    <p>The concept of Semantic Divergence (shift, mismatch) is intended to describe more subtle cases than false cognates<a id="ast6Back" href="#ast6">*</a> and "false friends of the translator", when word pairs in two languages indeed have similar meaning, and are considered equivalents, but have different semantic cores and cultural overtones. And accordingly the perception of such words by native speakers differs.</p>

    <p>Example:<br> 
Happiness (English) — a calm state of satisfaction, not necessarily a state of euphoria, ecstasy and exaltation.<br>
Счастье (Russian) — an exalted experience of fullness, meaning of being, delight and highest degree of satisfaction.</p>

<p>It should be taken into account that here we are talking about the meaning of words, not about the state of a particular person. If we try to express in percentages exclusively for clarity the emotional coloring of words, then happiness would be 80% satisfaction, contentment and 20% intensive vivid experience, whereas счастье on the contrary is an emotionally loud state at 80% and 20% peace and measuredness of being, if they are included in the understanding of happiness at all.</p>

<p>That is, the Pali word somanassa with a stretch could be appropriately described by the word happiness, but the word счастье would be inappropriate and contradictory, not to mention the word sukkha, which has fundamental meaning as the opposite of dukkha and is defined in the suttas as bodily pleasant.</p>

<p><code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">Katamañca, bhikkhave, sukhindriyaṁ?</code><br> 
And what, monks, is the faculty of pleasure? 
<code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">Yaṁ kho, bhikkhave, kāyikaṁ sukhaṁ, kāyikaṁ sātaṁ, kāyasamphassajaṁ sukhaṁ sātaṁ vedayitaṁ—</code><br> 
That which, monks, is bodily pleasure, bodily comfort, pleasure comfort born of bodily contact felt — 
<code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">idaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, sukhindriyaṁ.</code><br> 
this is called, monks, the faculty of pleasure. 
<br><br>
<code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">Katamañca, bhikkhave, somanassindriyaṁ?</code> <br> 
And what, monks, is the faculty of satisfaction? 
<code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">Yaṁ kho, bhikkhave, cetasikaṁ sukhaṁ, cetasikaṁ sātaṁ, manosamphassajaṁ sukhaṁ sātaṁ vedayitaṁ—</code>  <br>
That which, monks, is mental pleasure, mental comfort, pleasure comfort born of mind contact felt — 
<code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">idaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, somanassindriyaṁ.</code> <br>  
this is called, monks, the faculty of satisfaction. 
<br><br>
<a href="https://dhamma.gift/r/?s=k%C4%81yika%E1%B9%81%20sukha%E1%B9%81&q=sn48.36#4.2">sn48.36</a></p>

<p>In the case of happiness the problem is fundamental along with dukkha, but due to the application of contextual translation, the reader less often but still encounters the translation of the word sukha as pleasant bodily feeling. With taṇhā the case is more severe, and the problem is larger, since the reader has no opportunity to learn that taṇhā is not "thirst" from the English language.</p>

    <p>Taṇhā Pali or tṛṣṇā Sanskrit. They indeed can denote clinging, sticking, stickiness, grasping and even need for drinking, but these are phenomena that can be pleasant, light, agreeable, desirable, including in a figurative sense. Whereas "thirst" in English - is loud and mostly negative concept, even when used in positive sense, as "thirst for knowledge" or "thirst for travel". We are talking about the word itself, not about whether it is good to want knowledge or not.</p>

    <p><a href="/r/?q=sn56.11&s=ta%E1%B9%87h%C4%81#4.4">sn56.11</a> - if taṇhā were a full equivalent of the English word thirst, then this should be either an unpleasant experience of dryness and dehydration, or a strong often passionate striving, need, craving, very focused on the result phenomenon (thirst for life - to preserve life and its quality at any cost, thirst for knowledge - desire to obtain information or experience without paying attention to other benefits).</p> 

    <p>But in the definition of the Second Noble Truth it is stated that 'taṇhā' <strong>is accompanied</strong> sahagata literally Pali "goes together" with joy-pleasure and passion-enchantment. Not "pursues joy and passion" - as in case of their lack or "connected with them" - as a potential outcome upon their obtaining, but, as if they were already present in the current experience. Judging by the metaphors with one exhausted from heat and thirst, tasinā would be more appropriate in such a case.</p>

<p>Delighting here-and-there. tatratatrābhinandinī, ~now this, now that delighting - this is not an attribute of strong one-directional, result-focused "thirst" from the English language. Gathering these details together, it would be more appropriate to use the word "wanting" (as moderate even pleasant wanting) for taṇhā. But in any case both thirst and wanting lead to pleonasm in case of kama-tanha. Including about these problems below.</p>
</li>

<li> 
    <h4>Issues with Sanskritocentrism</h4>
    <p>Sanskritocentrism (pan-Sanskritism)<a id="ast2Back" href="#ast2">*</a> is considered a non-optimal approach for understanding the Buddha's Teaching. The Buddha's Teaching in exhaustive completeness exists in Pali, but not in Sanskrit. Also chronologically it was formulated in Pali earlier. To assume that the conceptual base of Pali - Dhamma and Sanskrit - Hindu base of sacred texts is identical is rash. </p>
    <p>Even within one teaching, one religion, divergences in meanings of concepts are so great that separate, sometimes hostile, movements, schools, sects are formed. But at the same time, it is assumed that two languages containing the heritage and burden of many dozens of teachings, schools and many hundreds of sects will coincide down to subtleties and nuances. </p>

<p> Also the imaginary absence of false cognates and "false friends of the translator" between the two languages can serve as a good illustration of the unconvincingness of the pro-Sanskrit approach to Pali. As if someone made an illogical equation: "if languages have similar grammar and many related words, then the key concepts of teachings are also identical".</p> 

    <p>Atta and Atman serve as a vivid example of obviously existing divergences and non-interchangeability of meanings. Atta (essence, selfhood, ~autonomy, bypassed "I") Pali and Atman (higher "Self") Sanskrit. </p>

        <p>With the above in mind, in cases where Pali texts indeed lack context or examples, Sanskrit still can be used — provided that this does not lead to contradictions like listed below. If definition of concept exists in Pali, but Sanskrit meanings contradict them, then the latter are not applied.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples of terminological divergences:</strong></p>
    <p><code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">duḥkha</code>, <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">tṛṣṇā</code>, <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">kāma</code> and <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">karma</code>, possibly in some cases are "suffering", "thirst", "sensual desire" and "action" within some teaching recorded in Sanskrit. But in Pali, if primarily for establishing terms Pali texts were taken into account, not literal transfer of meanings and parallels between two languages, this would be unlikely.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples from Pali texts:</strong></p>
    
    <p>1. <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">dukkha</code>:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=dn22&s=dukkha#18.18">dn22</a> - definitions of the concept in the practical realization of the four noble truths</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=mn141&s=dukkha#16.1">mn141</a> - definitions of the concept in the four noble truths. 
<br> 

    <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass-upāyāsa</code><br>

  Suffering [meaning 1], lamentation, pain, "suffering" [meaning 2], despair</p>

If we talk about suffering, then in the direct sense it is either soko - very strong bodily and mental pain, in which the experiencer:<br>

<code class="lang-pli" lang="pi"><strong>socati</strong> kilamati paridevati, urattāḷiṁ kandati, sammohaṁ āpajjati</code><br>
suffers, languishes, cries, beats-breast-weeps, falls into confusion.  
<br>
or domanassa in the figurative meaning of "suffering", as mental pain.
</p>

</li>
    </ul>

        <li><p>Two Pali terms — taṇhā and tasinā<a id="ast4Back" href="#ast4">*</a> — quite mechanically, without considering the context of usage in the Suttas, were attributed full synonymous meaning between themselves and with the Sanskrit tṛṣṇā, although considering what is described in the block about "Semantic shifts", this problem may be connected not with Sanskrit, but with translation of both languages without considering the difference in meanings of words, which can be gleaned from description. 
</p>
<p>

        However, mostly "Sanskrit" problem also takes place. The kinship of words tṛṣṇā, taṇhā and tasinā is explained by standard phonetic mutation: tṛṣṇā → taṇhā (there are only about three such words in the entire core of original Pali texts kṛṣṇa → kaṇha, uṣṇa → uṇha) and similarity of tṛṣṇā and tasinā (tṛ → t, ṣ → s, ṇā → nā) is also easy to trace.

        But phonetic mutation cannot be a guarantee that the meanings of words are also "transferred", especially since as a result of "mutation" of one word both "receive" completely identical meanings. 
</p>

<p>
            Exaggerated example: as if it were said the following: here is the word "hot" in language Z, - it is a complete synonym of two words from language X "heat" and "fire", therefore both words in language X are complete synonyms.
            <br>
        
            <!--<br> 
            <br>If adapting the example to tṛṣṇā and taṇhā with tasinā:
            Suppose in Sanskrit it is "desire" (moderate, even acceptable as "thirst for travel"), in Pali "wanting" (weaker than desire) and "thirst" (real in both direct and figurative senses). Can these three words be equated and said to be the same?  --> 

        </p>
<p>
        Divergences in meaning and usage of Pali taṇhā and tasinā between themselves are quite easily traceable in the texts below. taṇhā is used where the phenomenon is associated with joy and passion-enchantment, which delights here-and-there, but tasinā is used in cases with desert, heat and exhaustion in more extreme circumstances.</p></li>

        <li><a href="/r/?q=sn12.68&s=tasito">sn12.68</a> - circumstances suitable for real strong "thirst" are described and here a derivative word from tasinā is used, not taṇhā, but if this is a phenomenon related to desire to drink, then there would be pleonasm with pipāsito: thirsty, desiring to drink. in any case, in such a context does not fit "accompanied by joy-passion, here-and-there delighting", which is said many times about taṇhā.</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=snp3.2&s=ta%E1%B9%87h%C4%81#12.3">snp3.2</a> - same case taṇhā is not used, instead tasina, and same tautology with pipāsā</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=an4.10&s=ta%E1%B9%87h#1.6">an4.10</a> - also not taṇhā, but tasina, and tautology with pipāsā</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=an4.184&s=ta%E1%B9%87h#3.2">an4.184</a> - if taṇho - is thirst, then there would be tautology with pipāso, moreover here clearly pipāso has figurative meaning, but when this word is used in direct meaning - it means "desire to drink".</li>

        <li><a href="/r/?q=an10.62&s=ta%E1%B9%87h#2.2">an10.62</a> - what is the nourishment of thirst? Thirst is absence, not nourishment itself</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=iti109&s=ta%E1%B9%87h#3.3">iti109</a> - river's flow is thirst. State of water absence is water flow.</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=sn41.5&s=ta%E1%B9%87h#5.10">sn41.5</a> - similar contradiction with water flow</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=mn9&s=ta%E1%B9%87h%C4%81#11.5">mn9</a> - from accumulation of thirst - accumulation of nourishment (logically should be opposite. from disappearance of nourishment - accumulation of thirst, or at least from disappearance of thirst - accumulation of nourishment)</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=an4.199&s=ta%E1%B9%87ha#2.2">an4.199</a> - Listed phenomena are so subtle that on the contrary, thirst can be their result, but to call 'I - am' and further thirst or its currents, in the meaning of 'acute need of something' is very difficult. In this passage we are talking about subtle, fundamental states that are inherent even to beings devoid of 'thirst' in the generally accepted meaning of this word.</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=an4.9&s=ta%E1%B9%87ha#2.1">an4.9</a> - Thirst is not the source of pain, but either one of the types of pain, or on the contrary, it is striving to stop something unpleasant. Otherwise it would turn out that thirst for water is the cause of unpleasant sensations of dryness. But on the contrary, thirst as striving to drink is the result of unpleasant sensations of dryness.</li>
        <li><a href="/r/?q=an6.61&s=ta%E1%B9%87ha#12.4">an6.61</a> - Listed phenomena including phasso can be so subtle that there can be no talk of any thirst in figurative, or even direct sense of the word, especially in moments of 'quenched thirst', but still these phenomena are stitched and held together, whether there is 'strong wanting' or not. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    In Pali texts taṇhā has more complex, more subtle and less loud meaning than English word "thirst" in direct and figurative. And mechanical equation of two Pali terms taṇhā and tasinā with Sanskrit tṛṣṇā.</p>

“A person, desiring good, desiring benefit, desiring protection from yoke”, monks, of Tathagata this is the designation, of Arahant, of Rightly Awakened. <a href="https://dhamma.gift/r/?s=hitak%C4%81m&q=mn19#26.10">mn19</a><br><br>
it would be inappropriate to assume that Tathagata would compare himself with a person passionately desiring others' good, or his own.

    <p>Listed texts show that Pali <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">dukkha</code>, <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">taṇhā / tasinā</code>, <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">kāma</code>, <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">kamma</code> never were full analogs neither of Sanskrit equivalents, nor of their designations in English translations, but precisely "suffering", "thirst", "action" and "sensual desire" - this is "standard", universally used Buddhist terminology.</p>

    <p>With the above in mind, in cases where Pali texts indeed lack context or examples, Sanskrit still can be used — provided that this does not lead to contradictions like listed ones. If definition of concept exists in Pali, but Sanskrit meanings contradict them, then the latter are not applied.</p>

<p> <a id="ast1" href="#ast1Back">1*</a> By contextual translation is meant using different words for the same word in Pali. Systemic translation implies more complex analysis of all occurrences of a word or concept in Suttas and Vinaya and finding universal, common word or word cluster (preferably close but clarifying).</p>

<p> <a id="ast8" href="#ast8Back">2*</a> 
    Open approach to understanding compound words implies, for example: Noble-Truth - this is both truth of the Noble, and good producing truth, and from nobles, and for becoming noble, and for nobles.
    <br><br>
    Also: like dash in dates "1-10" (from first to tenth) is not equal only to "1 and 10" — so in Pali compound words, for example, "ascetics-brahmins", does not mean only "ascetics and brahmins", but the whole range of representatives of spiritual sphere — from ascetics to brahmins. In the same way the whole spectrum of phenomena from joy to passion, as in case of <code class="lang-pli" lang="pi">nandīrāga</code>, and not only joy and passion.
    <br><br>
But as described earlier, case endings will be used for words which don't have suitable form of compound word in English, for example, instead of "sufferingo-lamentationo-paino-discontento-despair" will be "suffering-lamentation-pain-discontent-despair" although the first is implied.

        In English<br> 
<strong>pain</strong>:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>[meaning 1]</strong> in direct sense: wide spectrum of unpleasant bodily sensations.</li>
        <li><strong>[meaning 2]</strong> in figurative sense - problem, limitation, inconvenience, something requiring solution and improvement. "Pain of loneliness", "customer pain".</li>
    </ul></p>
      <p> <strong>suffering</strong>:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>[meaning 1]</strong> in direct sense: very strong both bodily and mental pain simultaneously or separately.</li>
        <li><strong>[meaning 2]</strong> in figurative sense - mental pain, mental discomfort.</li>
    </ul>

<p> <a id="ast5" href="#ast5Back">5*</a> 
False friends of the translator — words formally similar, but with partial or distorted coincidence of meanings.<br><br>

Examples from English and Russian languages:<br> 
Aggressive — "energetic and also aggressive" and "only aggressive, not connected with energy".<br>
Sympathy — "compassion" and симпатия — "attraction"<br><br>
</p>
<p> <a id="ast6" href="#ast6Back">6*</a> 
False cognates — words similar in sound and origin, but with different meaning.<br>
Examples from English and Russian languages:<br> 
Fabric — "cloth" and фабрика — "factory"<br>
Magazine — "periodical" and магазин — "store"
</p>

<p> <a id="ast2" href="#ast2Back">7*</a> Partially described below problems may be connected not so much with Sanskrit, but with contextual translation. Since most of suitable meanings can be found in Sanskrit dictionaries too. But still translator's choice in favor of what is not in Suttas and Vinaya should be justified by something, apart from tradition (including translation tradition), and often it is precisely references to Sanskrit.</p>

<p> <a id="ast4" href="#ast4Back">8*</a> Word tasina itself is not found in all editions of canon, but its derivative tasito is found in vast majority of editions in metaphors with one exhausted from heat and thirst.</p>
